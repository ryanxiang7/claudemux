/**
 * `tm ask "<prompt>"` — borrow an idle named codex teammate, run one
 * turn on a fresh thread, return the teammate. The "pool" is the
 * spawned `codex-<n>` set; this verb does not name a teammate. Always
 * routes into the codex driver, never into the tmux path.
 *
 * Codex-only by definition (decision multi-engine-tui-architecture): a claude teammate is named,
 * so a "borrow from the pool" verb belongs to the engine whose
 * teammates are pool-shaped.
