/**
 * Teammate name parser + nested-name validation.
 *
 * Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"Nested teammate names" opens up names containing `/` —
 * the CLI accepts `tm spawn flow/flow-1`, the file builders treat the name
 * as opaque, and each engine encodes the name into whatever identifier its
 * runtime needs (tmux session, Codex registry directory, …). This module
 * is the one place CLI input is validated against the structural rules
 * common to every engine.
 *
 * Three structural rules:
 *
 *  - The name is at least one segment, each segment one-or-more characters
 *    drawn from `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`. Leading and trailing `/` are rejected;
 *    empty segments (`a//b`) are rejected.
 *
 *  - A name that contains `/` must not also contain the literal
 *    substring `__`. The Claude engine encodes `/` → `__` to land on a
 *    tmux-safe session name (`tmuxSessionName` in
 *    `persistence/paths.ts`); a nested name like `flow__/1`
 *    would encode to `teammate-flow____1`, which collides with the
 *    encoding of `flow/_/1` — the simplest way to keep the encoding
 *    unambiguous is to reject this single overlap rather than reserve
 *    `__` in every raw name. A flat name like `flow__1` (no `/`) is
 *    legal and round-trips through the tmux session name unchanged.
 *
 *  - The name must not start with `.` and must not be exactly `.` / `..` —
 *    those collide with filesystem semantics for the engine extension
 *    directories under `/tmp/teammate-codex/<name>/`.
