/**
 * The single source of truth for a teammate's identity. Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture
 * §"TeammateRecord — one base JSON, engine-private extensions, hooks-
 * managed files left alone" collapses what `tm` itself writes and reads
 * (engine, cwd, createdAt, …) into one JSON at `/tmp/teammate-<name>.json`;
 * engine-private state lives under the engine's persistence module;
 * hooks-managed marker files (`.busy`, `.last`, `.sid`, `.ready`, idle
 * marker) stay separate because Bash hooks cannot atomically rewrite
 * JSON.
 *
 * `TeammateRecord` is the abstract base every per-engine record extends.
 * It owns the JSON-serialised base fields plus the `markerPath(name)`
 * builder (one named function, so the file shape is changed in one
 * place — decision cross-process-cross-platform-invariants's path-builder discipline). A subclass declares
 * its engine-private extension files via `engineExtensionFiles()`, which
 * `tm doctor` consumes to enumerate everything to reap for a given
 * teammate.
 *
 * Phase 1 lands the base + the abstract seam. Phase 2a (Claude) and
 * Phase 2b (Codex) override `engineExtensionFiles()` and the engine's
 * file builders. The Phase 1 stubs in `engines/<kind>/persistence.ts`
 * throw `not implemented in Phase 1` from the abstract slot.
