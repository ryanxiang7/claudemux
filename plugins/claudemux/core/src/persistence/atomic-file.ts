/**
 * Atomic file primitives.
 *
 * Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"TeammateRecord" gives the registry layer one rule: writes
 * to `/tmp/teammate-<name>.json` are atomic, so a verb that reads the file
 * mid-write never sees a half-written record. Atomic on POSIX is
 * write-tmp-then-rename(2): a rename onto an existing path is a single
 * dentry swap and another reader observes either the old contents or the
 * new contents, never a torn write.
 *
 * `reserveExclusive` is the matching primitive for the spawn path: create
 * the marker with `O_CREAT | O_EXCL` so a second concurrent `tm spawn` of
 * the same name fails immediately. The registry layer uses this to enforce
 * the "cross-engine name reuse is forbidden" rule (decision codex-engine-flag §4 carried
 * forward by multi-engine-tui-architecture).
 *
 * Both functions go through this module rather than scattering
 * `writeFileSync` calls at the use sites — the next refactor that wants to
 * swap in `fs/promises` or add fsync semantics changes one file.
