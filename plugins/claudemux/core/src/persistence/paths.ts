/**
 * Path builders for every cross-process file the core touches.
 *
 * Path-builder discipline (repo CLAUDE.md, decision cross-process-cross-platform-invariants): every path under
 * `/tmp/teammate-*`, `/tmp/claude-idle/*`, and Claude Code's project-dir root
 * is constructed by a named function here — never by string concatenation at
 * a use site. The `/tmp` protocol is the coupling layer between `tm`, the
 * Bash hooks, and this core; spreading its shape across literals turns the
 * next schema change into a non-atomic multi-file sweep.
 *
 * The hooks are Bash and cannot import this module, so they re-declare the
 * same builders inline (`hooks/on-stop.sh`, `hooks/on-busy.sh`). The shapes
 * here must stay byte-for-byte identical to those — see
 * `.agents/domains/cross-process-protocol.md` for the contract.
