/**
 * `IdentityStoreWriter` — the verb-layer-facing seam for the identity
 * file. Decision multi-engine-tui-architecture §"Verb is the abstraction" pulls `VerbContext`'s
 * `identity` field out as an interface so the verb code does not import
 * the persistence module directly; the Phase 1 `NoopIdentityStore` lives
 * in `verbs/context.ts`, and Phase 2a's production implementation lives
 * here.
 *
 * The only mutation verbs trigger is `remove(name)` — `killVerb` calls it
 * after a successful kill so a later `tm spawn` of the same name is not
 * blocked by a stale record. Spawn-time `reserve` and per-verb reads go
 * through `persistence/identity-store.ts` directly (the verb file owns
 * the rest of the spawn flow).
