/**
 * The `TmResult` shape — what every `tm` verb returns — and `resolveTmBinary`,
 * which locates the user-installed `tm` PATH entry.
 *
 * Stage 3c retired the Bash `bin/tm`; the orchestrator is now a pure Node CLI
 * and no verb shells out to `tm`. The runtime shell-out functions that used to
 * live here (`runTm` / `runTmRaw`) are gone with it.
 *
 * Two seams remain useful and keep their home in this module:
 *
 *  - `TmResult` / `TmRunOptions` — the call shape every `NativeVerb` produces
 *    and the optional stdin a verb may consume. Module-public types so the
 *    CLI front end and the conformance harness see the same contract.
 *  - `resolveTmBinary` — used by the live-teammate integration harness to
 *    locate the PATH entry it drives. It honors `CLAUDEMUX_TM`, so the same
 *    harness can be re-aimed at any custom `tm` binary without code change.
