/**
 * The live-teammate integration harness.
 *
 * The conformance harness (`test/conformance.test.ts`) pins the migrated verbs
 * to `tm`'s behavior with a *faked* tmux and no real Claude Code — it cannot
 * reach the racy hot path (`spawn`, `send`, `wait`, `compact`, `resume`), whose
 * correctness depends on a real `claude` REPL, real `tmux send-keys`, the
 * claudemux hooks, and the `/tmp/claude-idle` turn signal actually firing.
 *
 * This harness drives that hot path end to end: it spins up real `claude`
 * teammates in real tmux sessions through `tm` and asserts the round-trips
 * complete. It is opt-in — slow, and it needs a working `claude` install — so
 * it runs under its own vitest config (`vitest.integration.config.ts`), never
 * as part of `npm test`. See `test/integration/README.md`.
 *
 * ## What the harness must arrange for a teammate to work
 *
 * - **Directory trust.** A `claude` REPL started in a never-before-seen
 *   directory shows a blocking "do you trust this folder?" dialog; a teammate
 *   has no human to answer it, so its hooks never fire. The harness pre-seeds
 *   `hasTrustDialogAccepted` for each fixture repo into `~/.claude.json` — a
 *   *targeted* read-modify-write that only ever adds/removes the harness's own
 *   `projects.<fixture-path>` keys, never a wholesale save/restore (that would
 *   clobber the concurrent writes every other Claude Code process makes to
 *   that file). See decision live-teammate-integration-harness.
 * - **The claudemux plugin.** A teammate's hooks come from the claudemux
 *   plugin being installed and enabled for the machine. The harness does not
 *   inject the plugin; it treats it as a precondition — `probeLiveTeammate`
 *   spawns one throwaway teammate and checks its SessionStart hook fired, and
 *   the suite skips with a clear reason if it did not.
 *
 * ## The `tm` indirection — the seam the verb migration flips
 *
 * Every `tm` invocation routes through `resolveTmBinary` (`src/tm.ts`), which
 * honors the `CLAUDEMUX_TM` environment override. Today that resolves to the
 * Bash `bin/tm`. When stage 3's hot-path verbs are migrated to native code,
 * pointing `CLAUDEMUX_TM` at the native CLI re-aims this whole suite at it —
 * the harness itself does not change.
