# claudemux "session-idle" hook.
#
# Bound to ALL of: Stop, StopFailure, PostCompact, SessionEnd. These are
# every event that transitions the session from "actively working" back
# to "ready for input" (or "gone"). On every fire:
#   1) rm /tmp/claude-idle/<sid>.busy           (clear the BUSY marker)
#   2) (Stop only) extract the assistant's last-turn text into <sid>.last
#   3) touch /tmp/claude-idle/<sid>             (the wait-idle signal)
#
# The .last file lets the dispatcher recover a full reply without scraping
# tmux scrollback (which truncates) and without parsing jsonl itself. It
# is meaningful only for Stop — the other three events don't have an
# assistant turn to extract:
#   - StopFailure: API error; whatever the model emitted before the error
#                  may not constitute a settled turn
#   - PostCompact: the jsonl has just been REWRITTEN; "last assistant"
#                  doesn't correspond to anything the user said
#   - SessionEnd:  session is going away; nothing to extract
# For those we still want the BUSY clear and the idle marker (so anything
# that was 'tm wait'-ing wakes up promptly), but we skip the .last work.
#
# Hook stdin is the harness JSON: { session_id, transcript_path,
# hook_event_name, ... }. We always exit 0 — the harness does not want a
# hook to fail the turn.
