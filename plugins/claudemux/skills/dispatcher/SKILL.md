name: dispatcher
description: Manage dispatcher-style coordination across sibling git repos from a parent workspace. Use when the user asks to spawn, dispatch, message, resume, inspect, compact, or kill Claude/Codex teammates; run one-shot Codex pool work with tm ask; coordinate work across sibling repos; check teammate state; host local scheduled work; or maintain the dispatcher task ledger. Also use when the user names dispatcher concepts such as "派一个 / 起一个 teammate / 下发任务 / 看看 X 在干啥 / 多仓 / dispatcher".

# Dispatcher: multi-repo teammate orchestrator

Operations manual for dispatcher-style work from a parent directory of sibling git repos. The dispatcher routes target-repo work to repo-local Claude or Codex execution, waits, reads back, updates the task ledger, and reports the result. Detailed per-scenario operational steps live in `references/<scenario>.md`.

> **`tm` is the helper script** bundled with this plugin. Examples below call it as bare `tm`. Claude Code auto-prepends each installed plugin's `bin/` directory to `PATH`, so `which tm` resolves inside any Bash subshell of an interactive Claude Code session. If `tm` is not on `PATH`, use the absolute install path: `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claudemux/claudemux/<version>/bin/tm`. **Do not** rely on `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` from a generic Bash tool call; that variable is injected only when the harness runs plugin-defined commands, hooks, or skill bodies.

> **Verb contracts live in the script.** `tm --help` is the top-level synopsis; `tm <verb> --help` (or `tm help <verb>`) is the detailed flag/output contract for each verb. The shipped help is the source of truth. References in this skill explain scenario flow and edge cases; read `--help` for flags and exact stdout/stderr contracts.

## Confirm dispatcher scope

- The user asks to push work into another repo ("派一个到 `<repo>`", "去 `<repo>` 看看 X").
- The user asks about an existing teammate ("看看 alarm 在干啥", "问问 monorepo-1 现在的 git status").
- The user asks for a scheduled / recurring local job.
- The user asks to coordinate across multiple sibling repos or maintain the dispatcher task ledger.

If the request is a normal single-repo or single-file task inside a covered sibling repo, resolve the target repo and delegate the work into that repo. Keep repo-local instructions, git state, and tool output inside the worker context instead of mixing them into the dispatcher.

## Pick the right delegation form

Pick once, up front; switching delegation form mid-task requires rebuilding state in the new form. Use the dispatcher's own shell for dispatcher bookkeeping (`tm`, ledger edits, cron setup); use delegated execution for target-repo inspection or modification.

| Form | Pick when | Skip when |
|---|---|---|
| `claude -p` headless in the target repo | One-shot repo task that can finish in a single delegated turn, including reads, small edits, or focused analysis | You need a cron / loop / wakeup; you want to keep talking to it later |
| `Agent` teammate via Agent Teams (`team_name=<...>` on the Agent tool) | Parallel work across multiple repos that needs a shared task list or peer `SendMessage` | You need cron firing inside the teammate; you need teammate-level cwd; you need session resume; you need nested sub-teams |
| Claude tmux teammate (`tm spawn <repo>`) | Long-running Claude work that needs a real TUI REPL, a Remote Control session, resume, or optional cron tied to that teammate's lifecycle | Throwaway one-shot work; Codex-specific work |
| Persistent Codex daemon teammate (`tm spawn <name> --engine codex`) | Long-running Codex work that needs a named daemon and resumable persistent thread | Throwaway one-shot Codex work; cron or TUI-only behavior |
| Codex pool one-shot (`tm ask "..."`) | One Codex turn on a fresh ephemeral thread using an already-spawned idle Codex daemon | You need a named persistent Codex thread, ledger tracking, or later resume |

Cron firing is reliable only inside an interactive TUI REPL: this dispatcher, or a Claude tmux teammate launched by `tm spawn`. Keep cron on this dispatcher unless the user specifically wants the job tied to a Claude teammate's lifecycle. Do not host cron jobs in `claude -p`, Agent Teams, or Codex daemon teammates.

## The `tm` script

`tm` resolves the dispatcher directory from `TM_DISPATCHER_DIR` if set, otherwise `$PWD`. `/claudemux:setup` writes `TM_DISPATCHER_DIR` into the dispatcher root's `.claude/settings.json` so Claude Code injects it on dispatcher launch. If `tm doctor` reports `TM_DISPATCHER_DIR: unset` or points at the wrong directory, run `/claudemux:setup` from the dispatcher root or ask the user to relaunch there.

For Claude teammates, `<repo>` is the short name of a sibling subdirectory directly under the dispatcher dir; `tm spawn my-repo` starts tmux session `teammate-my-repo` with cwd `<dispatcher-dir>/my-repo`. Codex teammates are daemons, not tmux sessions; spawn them explicitly with `tm spawn <name> --engine codex`.

## Scenario routing

Match the user's intent to one scenario, then read the corresponding reference. Each reference is self-contained; read just the one that applies.

| When you're doing this | Read | Primary verb(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Pushing work into a repo via Claude tmux teammate | `references/dispatch-task.md` | `tm spawn <repo> --prompt "..."` / `tm send <repo> --prompt "..."` |
| Pushing work into a persistent Codex daemon teammate | `references/dispatch-task.md` | `tm spawn <name> --engine codex` / `tm send <name> --prompt "..."` |
| Borrowing an idle Codex daemon for one fresh ephemeral turn | `references/dispatch-task.md` | `tm ask "..."` |
| Composing a spawn / send prompt that references sibling-repo state | `references/sibling-memory.md` | `tm mem <repo>` |
| Waiting for a turn an external actor drove | `references/wait-and-readback.md` | `tm wait --fresh <repo>` / `tm wait <codex-name>` |
| Reading the fleet snapshot | `references/inspect-and-resume.md` | `tm states` |
| A teammate looks hung mid-turn and needs pane/process ground truth | `references/wait-and-readback.md` | `tm status <repo>` |
| Looking up past sessions or threads / resuming / re-reading a reply | `references/inspect-and-resume.md` | `tm history <repo>` / `tm resume <repo> <id>` / `tm last <repo>` |
| Checking or compacting a Claude teammate's context window | `references/compact-a-teammate.md` | `tm ctx <repo>` / `tm compact <repo>` |
| Appending a new active task or archiving a finished one | `references/ledger-and-archive.md` | `tm archive <id>` |
| Spawning an Agent Teams teammate | `references/agent-teams.md` | `Agent(team_name=...)` |
| Diagnosing `.sid` drift, a stuck Claude spawn, or surprising `tm states` output | `references/sid-rotation.md` | (debugging) |
| Fanning `/reload-plugins` to teammates after a plugin update | (no reference) | `tm reload --all` (or `tm reload <repo>...`) |

For any verb's flag/output contract: `tm <verb> --help`. Do not reason about `tm` from prior-conversation memory or model priors.

## Long-running waits

Run every verb that may block longer than a couple of seconds with `run_in_background: true` on the Bash tool. This covers `tm send` (sync default, blocks until Stop), `tm wait`, `tm spawn --prompt`, `tm resume --prompt`, `tm compact` (default 1800 s cap), `tm poll`, `tm reload`, and any file-polling loop you write yourself. After the call is backgrounded, wait for the task notification; do not chain `sleep N && cat <output-file>` to peek at the background output file.

Foreground waits block the dispatcher end-to-end, so keep foreground use to non-wait operations such as `tm ls`, `tm states`, `tm status`, `tm last`, `tm ctx`, `tm history`, `tm archive`, `tm kill`, `tm doctor`, `tm resume` without `--prompt`, and `tm spawn` without `--prompt` when you intentionally want launch readiness before continuing.

Long `sleep` chains are blocked by the harness sandbox. For "wait until X", use `until <check>; do sleep 4; done` with a time-bounded outer loop; run that loop in the background like every wait.

## Cron host rule

This dispatcher is the preferred cron host on this machine. The scheduler ticks only inside an interactive TUI REPL, not inside `claude -p`, Agent Teams teammates, or Codex daemon teammates.

- Place periodic work here. If the work itself belongs to a specific repo, the callback prompt can dispatch outward with Bash, `claude -p`, `tm send`, or a fresh delegated teammate.
- Jobs fire only while you are idle. Ongoing conversation delays firing.
- Jobs are session-only by default and die when this dispatcher process dies (`tmux kill-session dispatcher`, terminal close while not detached, Mac reboot).
- Recurring jobs auto-expire after 7 days.
- For approximate times, pick an off-minute (e.g. `7 * * * *`, not `0 * * * *`) because the platform-wide fleet aliases on `:00` and `:30`.

## Local dispatcher notes

User-specific notes accumulated by `/claudemux:optimize` live in `.claude/local-dispatcher-notes.md` under the dispatcher directory. At the start of a dispatcher session, check whether that file exists and read it if so. It is user-owned and survives plugin upgrades: anything that would be lost on a plugin update belongs there, not in the plugin-shipped skill body.

## Tool permission requests

The auto-mode classifier blocks the dispatcher from editing its own `settings.local.json` to grant itself new tool permissions. When the dispatcher needs a new Bash permission, hand the user a minimal JSON snippet to merge into `~/.claude/settings.local.json`, or point them at `/permissions` to do it interactively:

```json
{ "permissions": { "allow": ["Bash(<command>:*)"] } }
```

## Task ledger boot-up

Two files in this dispatcher's AutoMemory directory power the task ledger; file purposes, schema, and the `tm archive` flow live in `references/ledger-and-archive.md`. The boot rule is:

- **Read on boot**: `active-dispatcher-tasks.md` — before any cross-task decision, and whenever the user asks "what's running" / "看看现在在跑啥".
- **Never read on boot**: `dispatcher-tasks-archive.md` — on demand only, when the user asks about a past task or you need history to make a decision.
