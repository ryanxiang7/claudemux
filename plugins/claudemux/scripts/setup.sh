#!/usr/bin/env bash
# setup.sh — seed CLAUDE.md, idle dir, and TM_DISPATCHER_DIR for a
# claudemux dispatcher.
#
# The "dispatcher directory" is wherever the user runs `claude` from to drive
# teammates. There's no global registry; the runtime derives it at invocation
# (TM_DISPATCHER_DIR env if set, $PWD fallback for `tm`; each teammate
# session's recorded cwd for the SessionStart hook).
#
# Idempotent steps (in execution order):
#   1. Remove ~/.config/claudemux/config if present (no longer read; the
#      runtime derives the dispatcher dir from env or cwd).
#   2. Copy CLAUDE.md.template to <dispatcher-dir>/CLAUDE.md (skipped if the
#      existing CLAUDE.md already matches). On a customized CLAUDE.md that
#      differs from the template, pass --force to inject only the
#      @.workspace/imports.md marker block at the top; the body is
#      preserved.
#   3. Ensure /tmp/claude-idle/ exists (the directory `tm wait` / `tm send` polls).
#   4. Merge TM_DISPATCHER_DIR=<dispatcher-dir> into the dispatcher root's
#      .claude/settings.json `env` block. Claude Code injects entries from
#      that file as env at every claude launch, so `tm` reads the right
#      dispatcher dir even when the Bash tool's cwd has drifted to a sibling
#      repo. Idempotent: jq merge preserves any other env / setting keys
#      the user already has.
#   5. Seed <dispatcher-dir>/.workspace/ from templates/workspace/: profile
#      stubs (HTML-comment only — inert until edited), imports.md, notes/
#      and artifacts/ with their own README.md. Never overwrites a file
#      that already exists.
#   6. Initialize <dispatcher-dir>/.workspace/ as its own independent git
#      repo and make an initial commit. Skipped if .workspace/.git/ already
#      exists, if git is missing, or if the commit step fails (recovery
#      instructions printed in that case). Completely independent of any
#      git tracking at the dispatcher-dir level.
#   7. Print verification next steps.
#
# Not done here:
#   - Installing hooks. They ship with the plugin (hooks/hooks.json) and
#     follow the plugin's install/uninstall lifecycle.
#   - Starting tmux, claude, or any teammate.
#   - Editing ~/.claude/settings.json. The /claudemux:setup command's Step 2
#     handles Remote Control opt-in.
#   - Checking system dependencies (tmux, jq, claude). Step 0 of the
#     /claudemux:setup command handles those with explicit user prompts.

[setup] done.

Verify by starting a dispatcher session:
  1. From a regular shell, open a tmux session whose cwd is the dispatcher dir:
       tmux new-session -s dispatcher -c "$DISPATCHER_DIR"
  2. Inside that pane, launch Claude Code:
       claude
  3. Once Claude is at the prompt, spawn a teammate against a sibling repo:
       tm spawn <repo>      # <repo> is a direct subdirectory of $DISPATCHER_DIR
  4. Send a prompt; the reply lands on stdout (tm send is sync round-trip):
       tm send <repo> --prompt 'echo hello'
     You should see the teammate's text reply within a minute.

Notes:
  * \`tm\` is on PATH automatically (Claude Code prepends each installed
    plugin's bin/ directory).
  * \`tm\` reads the dispatcher dir from TM_DISPATCHER_DIR (now written to
    $SETTINGS_FILE) and falls back to \$PWD if that env is unset. The env
    is what protects \`tm\` from Bash-tool cwd drift — sanity-check with
    \`tm doctor\` from inside the dispatcher claude session.
  * The Stop hook touches /tmp/claude-idle/<sid> for every Claude Code
    session, including the dispatcher itself. Nothing waits on that signal.
  * AutoMemory and the live task ledger live under
    ~/.claude/projects/<cwd-sanitized>/memory/ — not managed by this script.
