#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check.sh — structural self-check for the .agents/ knowledge base.
#
# Five checks:
#   1) Broken links. Every Markdown link whose target is a repo-root path
#      (starts with "/", e.g. /.agents/components/tm.md or
#      /plugins/claudemux/bin/tm) must resolve to a file or directory that
#      exists. A broken link FAILS the check (exit 1).
#   2) Orphan docs. Every .agents/**/*.md file should be reachable by
#      following /.agents/*.md links starting from root.md. An unreachable
#      doc is reported as a WARNING (it does not fail the check — a freshly
#      added doc may simply not be wired into the navigation yet).
#   3) Hazard dispositions. Every research snapshot must carry a
#      "## Hazard dispositions" section so a flagged hazard cannot be
#      silently dropped at a hand-off. A research doc without one FAILS the
#      check (exit 1). index.md is the archive's table of contents, not a
#      snapshot, so it is exempt. See
#      .agents/decisions/research-hazard-dispositions.md.
#   4) Decisions index sync. Every .md under .agents/decisions/ (other than
#      README.md) must appear exactly once in the README.md index table, and
#      every index row must point at a real decision file. A row in the
#      table whose link target is missing, or a decision file missing from
#      the index, FAILS the check (exit 1). The decisions registry has no
#      sequence number after the rename, so README.md is the only browsable
#      registry — drift between the directory and the index would silently
#      hide records.
#   5) No stale NNNN ADR references. Decision records are addressed by
#      topic slug, not by 4-digit ID. A reference of the form
#      "decision NNNN" / "decisions NNNN" / "Decision NNNN" / "ADR NNNN"
#      anywhere in a tracked Markdown / shell / JS / TS file FAILS the
#      check (exit 1). The scan includes `.changeset/` fragments because
#      their summary line eventually lands in CHANGELOG.md and reaches
#      users; `dist/` is excluded because it is a build artifact. Source
#      comments and docs that still cite an old ADR by number can no
#      longer be resolved from the README, so they have to be rewritten
#      to a slug.
#
# Run from anywhere inside the repo:
#   bash .agents/scripts/check.sh
#
# Portable bash: no associative arrays (macOS ships bash 3.2), no GNU-only
# flags. Works on macOS and Linux.

# prose and "ADR NNNN" prose; an ADR is no longer addressed by a 4-digit id
# in either form. We rely on `git ls-files` so that whatever is tracked is
